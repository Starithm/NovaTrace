A sequence of 19 exposures of 540 s each and 4 exposures of 180s each (3.1 hrs in total) was secured in the NB1008 band, with mid time 2025 April 3 (on Apr. 2-4, about 20 days after the GRB).\\n\\nIn a preliminary reduction, no source is detected at the GRB position down to a 1-sigma upper limiting magnitude NB1008 ~ 23.5 (AB), calibrated with the communication pipeline for DES.\\n\\nWe also took a 0.35 hrs exposure in the i-band with DECam and no source is detected down to a 1-sigma upper limiting magnitude of i ~ 26.7 (AB), consistent with the high redshift of this GRB. \\n\\nIf the redshift 7.27 is correct from the previous spectroscopic and photometric confirmation (z ~ 7.27; Malesani et al., GCN 39732; Rakotondrainibe et al., GCN 39743), the NB1008 filter would cover the pure Lya flux of the GRB host galaxy. The NB1008 band‘s 1-sigma upper limit of 23.5 (AB) can be converted to a Lya flux of < 4.2e-17 erg/cm^2/s, and a Lya luminosity of < 3.1e+43 erg/s at z=7.27. Based on the line emission ratio of Lya to Ha in Case B recombination (Osterbrock et al. 1989) and the relation between SFR and the Ha luminosity (Kennicutt 1998), the derived SFR of the GRB host galaxy is < 28 M_sun/yr (1-sigma upper limit). \\n\"\n",

While the spectrum is noisy blueward of 3720 AA, we can set an upper limit to the redshift z < 2.06 due to the lack of Lyman forest. Four clear absorption features are apparent in clean regions of the spectrum, three of which match Si IV 1393, Si IV 1402 and the (blended) C IV doublet 1548,1550 at a common redshift z = 1.847. The fourth line seems marginally split and could be an intervening C IV doublet at z = 1.763, although no other features are seen to confirm this value.\\n\\nThe observed absorption system is somewhat peculiar (but not unprecedented), as some typically strong low-ionization features common in long GRB spectra (de Ugarte Postigo et al. 2012, doi:10.1051/0004-6361/201219894) are either non-detected or only marginally detected. This indicates a high-ionization environment, which has been previously linked to systems with low H I column density (e.g. Jakobsson et al. 2006, doi:10.1051/0004-6361:20066405; Thoene et al. 2011, doi:10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18408.x; Vielfaure et al. 2020, doi:10.1051/0004-6361/202038316). We thus consider z = 1.847 a viable possibility, and the most likely redshift of GRB 250403A.\\n\\nWe acknowledge excellent support from the ESO observing staff in Paranal, in particular Matias Jones, Claudia Paladini, Jesus Corral-Santana, and Cecilia Bustos.\"\n",
