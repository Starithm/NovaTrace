**TASK 1: Rating Sentences**

1. The 300V grism with no order-blocking filter was adopted, covering the wavelength range 3300-9600 AA (with potential second-order contamination redward of 6600 AA). **Rating: 4**
2. Observations started on 2025 April 4 at 02:15:01 UT (10.99 hr after the burst). **Rating: 2**
3. Two exposures of 600 s each were obtained. **Rating: 1**
4. From a 60 s acquisition image obtained on 2025 April 4 at 02:01:37 UT (10.76 hr after the burst), we measure R ~ 21.1 +/- 0.2 mag (AB) calibrated against nearby Pan-STARRS objects. **Rating: 3**
5. From a preliminary reduction of the spectrum, continuum is detected over the wavelength range 3600-9600 AA. **Rating: 5**
6. While the spectrum is noisy blueward of 3720 AA, we can set an upper limit to the redshift z < 2.06 due to the lack of Lyman forest. **Rating: 4**
7. Four clear absorption features are apparent in clean regions of the spectrum, three of which match Si IV 1393, Si IV 1402 and the (blended) C IV doublet 1548,1550 at a common redshift z = 1.847. **Rating: 6**
8. The fourth line seems marginally split and could be an intervening C IV doublet at z = 1.763, although no other features are seen to confirm this value. **Rating: 3**
9. The observed absorption system is somewhat peculiar (but not unprecedented), as some typically strong low-ionization features common in long GRB spectra are either non-detected or only marginally detected. **Rating: 5**
10. This indicates a high-ionization environment, which has been previously linked to systems with low H I column density. **Rating: 4**
11. We thus consider z = 1.847 a viable possibility, and the most likely redshift of GRB 250403A. **Rating: 7**
12. We acknowledge excellent support from the ESO observing staff in Paranal, in particular Matias Jones, Claudia Paladini, Jesus Corral-Santana, and Cecilia Bustos. **Rating: 1**

**TASK 2: Overall Summary**

The spectrum of GRB 250403A shows high-ionization features at a redshift z = 1.847, with additional evidence suggesting another possible redshift of z = 1.763. This system's peculiar characteristics point towards a high-ionization environment with low H I column density.
